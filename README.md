Supervised Conformance Checking using Recurrent Neural Network Classifiers

DIscriminator_conformance.py contains python code for the method. Has setting for both random antilog generation and noise addition antilog.

Notebooks contain three tests:
1) Testing the global conformance of the different models
2) Testing the local conformance (noise experiment + example) + distribution profile
3) A convergence test (adding more and more instances to the simulated log and the antilog).
