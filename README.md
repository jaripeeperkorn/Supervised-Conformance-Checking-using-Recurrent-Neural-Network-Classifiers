Supervised Conformance Checking using Recurrent Neural Network Classifiers

## The folder ML4PM contains the files discussed in the paper for the ML4PM workshop at ICPM 2020.
pad_discriminator_conformance.py.py contains python code for the method. Has setting for both random antilog generation and noise addition antilog.
Notebook contains the testing discussed in the paper. The code in this folder will soon be outdated.

# Updated, not yet shared:
- Log generation using pm4py library
- Local conformance checking using output a multiple time steps
